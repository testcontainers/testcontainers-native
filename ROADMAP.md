## 1.0 Release

What we want to do before 1.0, see the milestone [here](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-native/milestone/1): 

- [ ] Add support for core Testcontainers features
- [ ] Add a C++ binding library and class-based headers ([#12](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/12))
- [x] Make Testcontainers Native an official project
  listed on the [Testcontainers site](https://testcontainers.com/)
- [ ] Publish the project to common C/C++ package managers, e.g.
  [vcpkg](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/2) or
  [Conan](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/3))
- [ ] Deploy a proper documentation site, including Doxygen
- [ ] Setup proper developer environments, CI/CD and release automation

## Later Releases

- [ ] Ensure sufficient feature parity with Testcontainers for Go ([#6](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/6))
- [ ] Prototype and document support for other languages that leverage native libraries, in particular Swift
- [ ] Create more modules
