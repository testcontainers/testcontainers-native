[![Slack: testcontainers-native on slack.testcontainers.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/Slack-%23testcontainers%E2%80%94native-brightgreen?style=flat&logo=slack)](http://slack.testcontainers.org/)

A full public roadmap is coming soon.
See the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues) and,
in particular,
the pinned issues to learn about the key initiatives on the table.

## Key Objectives

What we want to do before 1.0: 

- [ ] Ensure sufficient feature parity with Testcontainers for Go ([#6](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/6))
- [ ] Add a C++ binding library and class-based headers ([#12](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/12))
- [ ] Prototype and document support for other languages that
  leverage native libraries, in particular Swift
- [x] Make Testcontainers Native an official project
  listed on the [Testcontainers site](https://testcontainers.com/)
- [ ] Publish the project to common C/C++ package managers
  ([vcpkg](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/2),
  [Conan](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/3))
