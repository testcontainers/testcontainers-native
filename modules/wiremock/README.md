# WireMock Module for Testcontainers C

This module allows provisioning the WireMock server as a standalone container within your tests,
based on [WireMock Docker](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-docker).
It adds some quality of life API to make WireMock usage more simple.

WireMock is a popular open-source tool for API mock testing with over 5 million downloads per month.
It can help you to create stable test and development environments,
isolate yourself from flakey 3rd parties and simulate APIs that donâ€™t exist yet.
WireMock has a rich matching system, allowing any part of an incoming request
to be matched against complex and precise criteria.

See [this page](https://testcontainers.com/modules/wiremock/)
for the list of modules for other languages.
