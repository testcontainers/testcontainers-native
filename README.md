This is not a standalone [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.org/) engine,
but a C-style shared library adapter for native languages like C/C++, D, Lua, Swift, etc.
It is an MVP SDK that can be later extended for the languages.
The project is based on [Testcontainers for Go](https://golang.testcontainers.org/)
which is one of the most powerful Testcontainers implementations.

Contributions and feedback are welcome!
Also join the `#testcontainers-native` channel on the [Testcontainers Slack](https://slack.testcontainers.org/).

## Key Features

- _Testcontainers for C/C++_ - a shared library and C-style headers that can be used in native projects
- Support for [C](./docs/c/README.md), [C++](./docs/cpp/README.md), [Swift](./docs/swift/README.md) and other native projects.
- Minimum viable Testcontainers API functionality:
  starting and terminating containers, passing files, exposing ports,
  accessing container logs, etc.
- Minimum HTTP client wrapper to simplify requests and assertions
- [Testcontainers for Go](https://golang.testcontainers.org/) under the hood, with all its reporting and resource management capabilities.
  Memory might leak a lot in the current versions, but we do not want containers to leak :)
- Support for [Testcontainers Modules](./modules/README.md)

This is what a very simple run without a test framework may look like.

## Quick Start

Follow the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md).

### Installing the library

It is advised to include CMake as a dependent module for now.
If you like living dangerously until proper vcpkg and Conan packages are ready,
you can optionally install the library to your system:

```bash
# NOT RECOMMENDED
cmake --install ..
```

## Documentation

### Using in C/C++/Swift projects

- [C projects](./docs/c/README.md)
- [C++ projects](./docs/cpp/README.md)
- [Swift projects](./docs/swift/README.md)

See [the examples and demos](./demo/README.md) for more examples.

### Using in other languages

TL;DR: You get the C header file, a shared library object or a DLL file from the
[Testcontainers for C](./docs/c/README.md) module.
Then, you can bind this native library in your project type.
It allows supporting many other languages that support using
native tooling via dynamically or statically linked libraries:

Disclaimer:
The schema above shows the most popular languages for Embedded systems,
based on the
[IEEE Spectrum 2021 Report](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2021)
and the [JetBrains 2021 Developer Ecosystem Survey for Embedded Software](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/embedded/).
More native languages exist and can be supported by Testcontainers Native.

Feel free to contribute examples or SDKs for the languages!
See the [Swift Solution Page](./docs/swift/README.md) for examples.
[Testcontainers Native Architecture](./docs/architecture/README.md)
describes how it can be done in principle.

## Credits

Using a complex Golang framework from C/C++ is not trivial.
Neither are the CMake files. This project would not succeed without many quality articles and help from the community.
